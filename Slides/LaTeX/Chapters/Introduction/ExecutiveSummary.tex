% TYPO3 Version 11.4 - Executive Summary

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Introduction}
	\framesubtitle{Executive Summary}

	\small

		We are almost there! The TYPO3 v11 release with long-term support is
		approaching fast. TYPO3 version 11.4 is the \textbf{feature freeze}
		version and marks the last phase of the v11 development cycle before
		the TYPO3 v11 LTS release.

		\vspace{0.2cm}

		This means that no new features are planned until the LTS release in
		October 2021. We are confident that TYPO3 v11.4 is stable and can be
		used in most projects in production.

		\vspace{0.2cm}

		Check it out: install the new version or run a test update of your
		existing instances and report any issues or hiccups you possibly
		encounter.
