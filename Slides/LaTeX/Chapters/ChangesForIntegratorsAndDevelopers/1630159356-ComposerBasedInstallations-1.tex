	\begin{itemize}
		\item The file "\texttt{PackageStates.php}" has become obsolete in
			Composer-based installations
		\item All extensions added to the system by Composer are now considered
			to be active
		\item Therefore, the Extension Manager and the TYPO3 CLI don't offer the
			option to activate/deactivate extensions anymore
		\item Composer-based TYPO3 installations don't need the file
			"\texttt{ext\_emconf.php}" in extensions anymore
		\item Developers may want to keep it for the time being though to retain
			compatibility with TYPO3 instances in non-Composer mode
		\item See
			\href{https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/11.4/Feature-94996-ConsiderAllComposerInstalledExtensionsAsActive.html}{changelog}
			for further details
